## üî® Install
Add as a dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
spinoff = "0.8.0"
```	

## ‚ö° Usage

```rust
use spinoff::{Spinner, spinners, Color};
use std::thread::sleep;
use std::time::Duration;

let mut spinner = Spinner::new(spinners::Dots, "Loading...", Color::Blue); 
sleep(Duration::from_secs(3));
spinner.success("Done!");
```

### Update a spinner

```rust
use spinoff::{Spinner, spinners, Color};
use std::thread::sleep;
use std::time::Duration;

let mut spinner = Spinner::new(spinners::Aesthetic, "Loading...", Color::Red); 
sleep(Duration::from_secs(3));
spinner.update(spinners::Dots2, "Retrying...", None);
sleep(Duration::from_secs(3));
spinner.stop()
```

### Specify an output stream

```rust
use spinoff::{Spinner, spinners, Color, Streams};
use std::thread::sleep;
use std::time::Duration;

let mut spinner = Spinner::new_with_stream(spinners::Line, "Loading...", Color::Yellow, Streams::Stderr);
sleep(Duration::from_secs(3));
spinner.stop_and_persist("üìú", "Task done.");
```

## üí´ Spinners

`spinoff` includes over 80+ spinner variants out of the box. 
All spinner variants are treated as features that can be enabled or disabled. By default, all of them are enabled for ease of use.
To disable/enable variants, you will have to edit your `cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
spinoff = { version = "0.8.0", features = ["dots", "arc", "line"] }
```

Any suggestions for new spinner variants are welcome. 

### Creating your own spinner
You can create your own spinner using the `spinner!` macro:

```rust
use spinoff::*;
use std::thread::sleep;
use std::time::Duration;

let frames = spinner!([">", ">>", ">>>"], 100);
let mut sp = Spinner::new(frames, "Hello World!", None);
sleep(Duration::from_millis(800));
sp.stop();
```

### Multiline messages
`spinoff` doesn't support spinners with multiline text out of the box. If you want to use it in your project, please look at [#27](https://github.com/ad4mx/spinoff/issues/27).

## ‚ùóNote for Windows Users
For colors to work properly, you need to add a few extra lines to your code: 
```rust
use colored::control
control::set_virtual_terminal(true).unwrap();
```
